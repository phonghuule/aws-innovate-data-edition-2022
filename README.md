# [Orchestrate data processing with Step Functions and the Redshift Data API](https://github.com/joshtow/Orchestrate-Data-Pipeline-with-Step-Functions)

In this lab, we explain how to use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate actions in your Amazon Redshift data warehouse using Amazon Redshift Data API. We create and use a Step Function model to load data to a data lake, catalog and prepare the data, load the data into Amazon Redshift and create data queries spanning the data warehouse and data lake with Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

Duration: Approximately 45 minutes

# [Using Amazon Macie to discover sensitive data and automatically update access controls](https://github.com/joshtow/Amazon-Macie-and-Lake-Formation-TBAC)

In this lab, learn how to configure Amazon Macie to automatically detect sensitive data in an S3 bucket and apply appropriate tags in AWS Lake Formation. Amazon Macie uses machine learning to discover sensitive data in S3 buckets while AWS Lake Formation provides tag-based access control to provide a scalable and flexible way to manage data access in the data lake.

Duration: Approximately 45 minutes
